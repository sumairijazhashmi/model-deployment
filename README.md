# Model Deployment
I'm trying to learn how to integrate and deploy machine learning models in different systems (websites, mobile apps, embedded systems) and how to run models in the cloud or in the browser. 
I'll be using this repo to track all of my projects I use to learn this.

## Project 1: MNIST Digit Classification 
Tech used: Flask for Backend API, React for Frontend

Process: Create a pickle file for the model and import the pickle file in the Flask app. Now, you can use the model's prediction (or any other) methods in the app.
